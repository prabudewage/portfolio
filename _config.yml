            <p>Doctoral candidate in Physics at The University of Texas at Dallas.</p>
            
            <p>My research focuses on the analysis of climate and remote sensing data to construct empirical machine learning models for predicting Particulate Matter concentration. 
            I also focus on development of computational algorithms based on physics theory to correct low-cost particulate matter sensor measurements during adverse weather conditions and estimate airborne nanoparticle concentrations.</p>
