## Experience
**Graduate Research Assistant (_June 2021 - Present_)**
- Over the course of my current research, I have gained both experimental and data analysis skills as an experimental physicist.
- I am quite familiar with programming languages such as Python, MATLAB, and Julia and I have been conducting several projects which includs data analysis and building - emperical machine learning models in python. 
- My work also included extensive big data analysis, interpolation, synchronization, automation, visualization and identification of potential variables for machine learning models utilizing Linux High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. 
- I have accumulated over two years of hands-on experience in atmospherics, environmental and remote sensing data analysis.
- Developing physics-based computational algorithm models.
- Preparing manuscripts for my PhD research dissertation and academic publications. 



## Projects
### Estimation of Particlulate Matter Concentration in United States
<!--[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048) -->

- Led data collection, processing, and analysis of 53 atmospheric variables from in-situ and remote sensing data utilizing Linux HPC clusters to fit and validate empirical machine learning models for predicting Particulate Matter concentration with 85% accuracy.
- Developed a physics-based algorithm for humidity correction in Particulate Matter concentration for commercially available low-cost sensors that do not incorporate a dry mechanism. This improvement increased the accuracy of data by 5% in R2 value.
- Introduced a computational method to estimate airbone nanoparticle (diameter < 50 nm) count in atmosphere. 

Developed emperical machine learning model in python using 53 climate and remote sensing variables to estimate Praticulate Matter in United States.
