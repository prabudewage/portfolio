## Experience
**Graduate Research Assistant (_June 2021 - Present_)**
- Led data collection, processing, and analysis of 53 atmospheric variables from in-situ and remote sensing data utilizing Linux HPC clusters to fit and validate empirical machine learning models for predicting Particulate Matter concentration with 85% accuracy.
- Developed a physics-based algorithm for humidity correction in Particulate Matter concentration for commercially available low-cost sensors that do not incorporate a dry mechanism. This improvement increased the accuracy of data by 5% in R2 value.
- Introduced a computational method to estimate airbone nanoparticle (diameter < 50 nm) count in atmosphere.
